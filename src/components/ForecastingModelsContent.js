          <p className="section-content">
            Time series analysis is the study of data points collected or
            recorded at successive points in time. This field involves
            identifying underlying structures such as trends, seasonalities, and
            cycles that characterize a dataset over a period. Analysts use
            various techniques to decompose a time series into its components,
            which can then be modeled individually. Statistical methods, such as
            moving averages and exponential smoothing, are often applied to
            indicate the underlying signal amidst randomness. This approach aids
            in forecasting and understanding temporal patterns in diverse fields
            like economics, weather forecasting, and stock market analysis.
            Furthermore, time series analysis plays a crucial role in anomaly
            detection and automated decision making, providing significant
            insights into historical behaviors and future expectations. By
            integrating data visualization and advanced analytics, modern
            approaches have elevated time series forecasting into an
            indispensable tool. The intricate balance between theory and
            application makes time series analysis both challenging and
            rewarding.

            <h2>GRU</h2>
          </div>
          <p className="section-content">
            GRU, or Gated Recurrent Unit, is a type of recurrent neural network
            that simplifies the LSTM architecture by merging certain gates while
            retaining the capacity to manage long-term dependencies. GRUs are
            designed to capture sequence information with fewer parameters,
            making them faster to train and often more efficient in certain
            contexts. The architecture employs gating mechanisms to decide how
            much past information should influence the future predictions,
            effectively handling variable-length sequences. Their computational
            simplicity does not compromise performance; in fact, they are
            well-regarded for tasks like language modeling, speech recognition,
            and time series forecasting. Researchers have found that GRUs can
            sometimes outperform more complex models, especially when data is
            limited. The balance between performance and efficiency makes them
            attractive for real-time applications where rapid predictions are
            critical. Their flexibility and strength in sequence modeling
            demonstrate the evolution of deep learning architectures over the
            past years.

            <h2>Other Forecasting Models</h2>
          </div>
          <p className="section-content">
            Beyond conventional time series methods, a myriad of forecasting
            models exist to address different data behaviors. Models such as
            Prophet, Holt-Winters, and N-BEATS provide alternative approaches by
            leveraging techniques ranging from additive regression to advanced
            deep neural network architectures. Prophet, developed by Facebook,
            emphasizes decomposability and trend analysis, making it robust in
            handling missing data and abrupt changes. Holt-Winters focuses on
            exponential smoothing, effectively capturing seasonal effects with a
            straightforward implementation. On the deep learning side, models
            like N-BEATS adopt a block-based design to forecast time series
            without relying on recurrence or convolutions, focusing solely on
            the inherent structure of the data. Each of these methods offers
            unique benefits and trade-offs in terms accuracy, interpretability,
            and computational requirements. The choice of model typically relies
            on the type of data and the specific forecasting challenges at hand.
            By combining insights from multiple models, ensemble strategies can
            further enhance forecasting performance, delivering more robust
            predictions in complex scenarios.
