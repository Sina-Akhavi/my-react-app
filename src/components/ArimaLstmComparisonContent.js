        </div>
        <p className="section-content">
          ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average and is a powerful statistical method for time series forecasting.
          It starts by transforming the data to achieve stationarity, allowing trends and seasonality to be analyzed more effectively.
          Once the dataset is stationary, past observations are leveraged to predict future values using autoregressive components.
          The integration step involves differencing the data to remove underlying trends, ensuring that fluctuations are stabilized.
          Additionally, a moving average part is applied that models the error of the forecast as a linear combination of error terms.
          This multi-step process allows ARIMA to capture both the autoregressive relationships and the error structure in data.
          With careful parameter tuning and diagnostics, ARIMA models can provide robust forecasts over a wide range of applications.
          Its systematic approach makes it a cornerstone method for time series analysis in many industries.
          Many practitioners favor ARIMA for its transparency and interpretability in understanding historical data trends.

          <h2>LSTM</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="section-content">
          LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, and these networks are engineered to overcome limitations of traditional RNNs.
          They incorporate specialized memory cells that allow the network to store and access information over long sequences.
          This capability ensures that both short-term and long-term dependencies are taken into account during prediction.
          Unlike classical models, LSTMs dynamically decide which pieces of information to keep, update, or discard.
          Their architecture is particularly suited for complex patterns where non-linearity plays a significant role.
          LSTMs have been effectively applied to domains like natural language processing, speech recognition, and financial forecasting.
          Heavily parameterized and capable of learning intricate data relationships, they excel in managing non-stationary data.
          Despite their computational intensity, their flexibility makes them a preferred choice for advanced sequence modeling.
          Extensive research and practical implementations underscore the LSTM's role in modern deep learning applications.

          <h2>ARIMA vs LSTM</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="section-content">
          Comparing ARIMA and LSTM requires an understanding of both their methodologies and data requirements.
          ARIMA, as a classical approach, performs exceptionally well on linear data where relationships are straightforward.
          Its parameters directly correlate to the data dynamics, making it easier to interpret forecasting results.
          In contrast, LSTM networks excel in modeling non-linear processes and can capture complex temporal dependencies.
          The trade-off often comes down to simplicity versus adaptive capacity, with ARIMA offering clarity and LSTM providing flexibility.
          LSTMs may demand more computational resources and time to train thoroughly but can outperform statistical models on intricate data.
          The choice between these models hinges on the nature of your dataset, the desired explainability, and overall predictive accuracy.
          In some cases, a combination of both approaches can yield robust forecasting solutions through ensemble methods.
          Ultimately, selecting the right model involves balancing interpretability, resource availability, and the demands of the forecasting task.
